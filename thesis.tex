    \section{Introduction}
        The microbiome refers to the complex community of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microbes, that inhabit various environment within living organisms \cite{microbiome-1, microbiome-3}. In humans, the microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining health \cite{microbiome-2}, influencing processes such as digestion \cite{microbiome-digestion-1}, immune response \cite{microbiome-immune-1, microbiome-immune-2, microbiome-immune-3}, and even mental health \cite{microbiome-mental-1, microbiome-mental-2, microbiome-mental-3}. These microbial communities are not static nor constant, but rather dynamic ecosystem that interacts with their host and respond to environmental changes. Recent studies have revealed that imbalances in the microbiome, known as dysbiosis, can contribute to a wide range of diseases, including obesity \cite{microbiome-obesity-1, microbiome-obesity-2, microbiome-obesity-3}, diabetes \cite{microbiome-diabetes-1, microbiome-diabetes-2, microbiome-diabetes-3}, infections \cite{microbiome-infection-1, microbiome-infection-2}, inflammatory conditions \cite{microbiome-inflammation-1, microbiome-inflammation-2, microbiome-inflammation-3}, and cancers \cite{microbiome-cancer-1, microbiome-cancer-2, microbiome-cancer-3, microbiome-cancer-4}. Thus, understanding the composition of the human microbiomes is essential for developing new therapeutic approaches that target these microbial populations to promote health and prevent diseases.

        (Brain-gut axis)

        16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing is one of the most extensively applied methods for characterizing microbial communities by targeting the conserved 16S rRNA gene, which contains both highly conserved and variable regions in bacteria \cite{16S-1, 16S-2}. The conserved regions enable universal primer binding, while the variable regions provide the specificity needed to differentiate microbial taxa. Among these regions, the V3-V4 region is frequently selected for sequencing due to its balance between phylogenetic resolution and sequencing efficiency \cite{16S-3}. Therefore, the V3-V4 region offers sufficient variability to classify a wide range of bacteria taxa while maintaining compatibility with widely used sequencing platforms.

        Diversity indices are essential techniques for evaluating the complexity and variety of microbial communities,in ecological and microbiological research \cite{Diversity-1, Diversity-2}. Alpha-diversity index attributes to the heterogeneity within a specific community, obtaining the number of different taxa and the distribution of taxa among the individuals, i.e., richness and evenness. On the other hand, beta-diversity index measures the variations in microbiome compositions between the individuals, highlighting differences among the microbiome compositions of the study participants. Altogether, by providing a thorough understanding of microbiome compositions, diversity indices, e.g. alpha-diversity and beta-diversity, allow us to investigate factors that affecting community variability and structure.

        (DAT selection)

        Classification is one of the supervised machine learning techniques used to categorized data into predefined classes based on features within the data. In other words, the method learns the relationship between input features and their corresponding output classes through the process of training a classification model using labeled data. Classification models are essential for advising choices in a wide range of applications, including medical diagnostics. Thus, researchers could uncover sophisticated connections in input features and corresponding classes and produce reliable prediction by utilizing machine learning classification.

        Random forest classification is one of the ensemble machine learning methods that constructs several decision trees during training and aggregates their results to provide classification predictions \cite{RF-1}. A portion of the features and classes--known as bootstrapping \cite{RF-2, RF-3, RF-4} and feature bagging \cite{RF-5, RF-6, RF-7}--are utilized to construct each tree in the forest. The majority vote from each tree determines the final classification, which lowers the possibility of overfitting in comparison to a single decision tree. Furthermore, random forest classifier offers several advantages, including its robustness to outliers and its ability to calculate the feature importance.

        Evaluating the performance of a machine learning classification model is essential to ensure its reliability and effectiveness in real-world solutions and applications. A confusion matrix is a tabular representation of predictions of classification, showing the counts of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) (Table \ref{tab:confusion}). From this matrix, evaluations can be derived: accuracy (ACC; Equation \ref{eq:ACC}), balanced accuracy (BA; Equation \ref{eq:BA}), F1 score (F1; Equation \ref{eq:F1}), sensitivity (SEN; Equation \ref{eq:SEN}), specificity (SPE; Equation \ref{eq:SPE}), and precision (PRE; Equation \ref{eq:PRE}). These metrics are in $[0, 1]$ range and high metrics are good metrics. The confusion matrix also helps in identifying specific types of errors, such as a tendency to produce false positive or false negatives, offering valuable insights for improving the classification model. By combining the confusion matrix with other evaluation metrics, researchers can comprehensively assess the classification metrics and refine it for real-world solutions and applications.

    \section{Predicting preterm birth using random forest classifier in salivary microbiome}
        \label{section:PTB}

        \textbf{This section includes the published contents}: \\
        \input{Documents/PTB.txt} \nocite{PTB-JW-1}

        \subsection{Introduction}
            Preterm birth (PTB), characterized by the delivery of neonates prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is one of the major cause to neonatal mortality and morbidity \cite{PTB-rate-1}. Multiple pregnancies including twins, short cervical length, and infection on genitourinary tract are known risk factor for PTB \cite{PTB-cause-1}. Nevertheless, the extent to which these aspects affect birth outcomes is still up for debate. Henceforth, strategies to boost gestation and enhance delivery outcomes can be more conveniently implemented when pregnant women at high risk of PTB are identified early \cite{PTB-care-1}.

            Prediction models that can be utilized as a foundation for intervention methods still have an unacceptable amount of classification evaluations, including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, despite a great awareness of the risk factors that trigger PTB \cite{PTB-prediction-1}. Several attempts have been made to predict PTB through integrating data such as human microbiome composition, inflammatory markers, and prior clinical data with predictive machine learning methods \cite{PTB-prediction-2}. Because it is affordable and straightforward to use, fetal fibronectin is commonly used in medical applications. However, with a sensitivity of only 56\% that merely similar to random prediction, it has a low classification evaluation \cite{PTB-prediction-3}. Due to the difficulty and imprecision of the method in general, as well as the requirement for a qualified specialist cervical length measuring is also restricted \cite{PTB-prediction-4}.

            Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) brought on by gestational inflammation and infection contribute to about 70\% of PTB cases \cite{PTB-prediction-5}. Nevertheless, as antibiotics and anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies were ineffective to decrease PTB occurrence rates, the pathology of PTB has not been entirely elucidated by inflammatory and infectious pathways \cite{PTB-mechanism-1}. Recent researches on maternal microbiomes were beginning to examine unidentified connections of PTB as a consequence of developmental processes in molecular biological technology \cite{PTB-mechanism-2}.

            However, as anti-inflammatory and antibiotic therapies were insufficient to lower PTB occurrence rates, infectious and inflammatory processes are insufficient to exhaustively clarify the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of PTB. It has been hypothesized that the microbiota linked to PTB originate from either a hematogenous pathway or the female genitourinary tract increasing through the vagina and/or cervix. \cite{PTB-mechanism-3}. Vaginal microbiome compositions have been found in women who eventually acquire PTB, and recent studies have tried to predict PTB risk using cervico-vaginal fluid \cite{PTB-mechanism-4}. Even though previous investigation have confirmed the potential relationships between the vaginal microbiome compositions and PTB, these studies are only able to clarify an upward trajectory.

            Multiple unfavorable birth outcomes, including PROM and PTB, have been linked to periodontitis as an independence risk factor, according to numerous epidemiological researches \cite{PTB-mechanism-5}. It is expected that the oral microbiome will be able to explain additional hematogenous pathways in light of these precedents; however, the oral microbiome composition of fetuses is limited understood.

            Hence, in order to identify the salivary microbiome linked to PTB and to establish a machine learning prediction model of PTB determined by oral microbiome compositions, this study examined the salivary microbiome compositions of PTB study participants with a full-term birth (FTB) study participants.

        \subsection{Materials and methods}
            \subsubsection{Study design and study participants}
                Between 2019 and 2021, singleton pregnant women who received treatment to Jeonbuk National University Hospital for childbirth were the participants of this study. This study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki \cite{Helsinki-1}. The Institutional Review Board authorized this study (IRB file No. 2019-01-024). Participants who were admitted for elective cesarean sections (C-sections) or induction births, as well as those who had written informed consent obtained with premature labor or PROM, were eligible.

            \subsubsection{Clinical data collection and grouping}
                Questionnaires and electronic medical records were implemented to gather information on both previous and current pregnancy outcomes. The following clinical data were analyzed:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item maternal age at delivery
                    \item diabetes mellitus
                    \item hypertension
                    \item overweight and obesity
                    \item C-section
                    \item history PROM or PTB
                    \item gestational week on delivery
                    \item birth weight
                    \item sex
                \end{itemize}

            \subsubsection{Salivary microbiome sample collection}
                Salivary microbiome samples were collected 24 hours before to delivery using mouthwash. The standard methods of sterilizing were performed. Medical experts oversaw each stage of the sample collecting procedure. Participants received instruction not to eat, drink, or brush their teeth for 30 minutes before sampling salivary microbiome. Saliva samples were gathered by washing the mouth for 30 seconds with 12 mL of a mouthwash solution (E-zen Gargle, JN Pharm, Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi, Korea). The samples were tagged with the anonymous ID for each participant and kept at 4 \textcelsius until they underwent further processing. Genomic DNA was extracted using an ExgeneTM Clinic SV kit (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea) following with the manufacturer instructions and store at -20 \textcelsius.

            \subsubsection{16s rRNA gene sequencing}
                Salivary microbiome samples were transported to the \input{Documents/Department.txt} of the \input{Documents/UNIST.txt}. 16S rRNA sequencing was then carried out using a commissioned Illumina MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Library methods were utilized to amplify the V3-V4 areas. 300 base-pair paired-end reads were produced by sequencing the pooled library using a v3 $\times$600 cycle chemistry after the samples had been diluted to a final concentration of 6 pM with a 20\% PhiX control.

            \subsubsection{Bioinformatics analysis}
                The independent $t$-test was utilized to evaluate the differences of continuous values between from the PTB participants than the FTB participants; $\chi$-square test was applied to decide statistical differences of categorical values. Clinical measurement comparisons were conducted using SPSS (version 20.0) \cite{SPSS-1}. At $p < 0.05$, statistical significance was taken into consideration.

                QIIME2 (version 2022.2) was implemented to import 16S rRNA gene sequences from salivary microbiome samples of study participants for additional bioinformatics processing \cite{QIIME2-1}. DADA2 was used to verify the qualities of raw sequences \cite{DADA2-1}. The remain sequences were clustered into amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Diversity indices, namely Faith PD for alpha diversity index \cite{FaithPD-1} and Hamming distance for beta diversity index \cite{Hamming-1}, were calculated. MWU test \cite{MWW-1}, and PERMANOVA multivariate test were evaluated for measuring statistical significance \cite{PERMANOVA-1, PERMANOVA-2}.

                Taxonomic assignment were implemented with HOMD (version 15.22) \cite{HOMD-1}. Afterward, DESeq2 was implemented to identify differentially abundant taxa (DAT) that could distinguish between salivary microbiome from PTB and FTB participants \cite{DESeq2-1}. Taxa with $| \log _2 \textrm{FoldChange} | > 1$ and $p < 0.05$ were considered as statistically significant.

                The taxa for predicting PTB using salivary microbiome data were determined using a random forest classifier \cite{RF-1}. Through stratified $k$-fold cross-validation ($k=5$) that preserves the existence rate of PTB and FTB participants, consistency and trustworthy classification were ensured \cite{Kfold-1}.

            \subsubsection{Data and code availability}
                All sequences from the 59 study participants have been added to the Sequence Read Archives (project ID PRJNA985119): \url{https://dataview.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/object/PRJNA985119?reviewer=6fdj2e9c8gp9vtf52n330e2h8j}. Docker image that employed throughout this study is available in the DockerHub: \url{https://hub.docker.com/r/fumire/helixco_premature}. Every code used in this study can be found on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/CompbioLabUnist/Helixco_Premature}.
        \newpage

        \subsection{Results}
            \subsubsection{Overview of clinical information}
                In the beginning, 69 volunteer mothers were recruited for this study. However, due to insufficient clinical information or twin pregnancies, 10 participants were excluded from the study participants. Demographic and clinical information of the study participants are displayed in Table \ref{tab:PTB-clinical}. Because PROM is one of the leading factors of PTB, it was prevalent in the PTB group than the FTB group. Other maternal clinical factors did not significantly differ between the FTB and PTB groups. There were no cases in both groups that had a history of simultaneous periodontal disease or cigarette smoking.

            \subsubsection{Comparison of salivary microbiomes composition}
                The salivary microbiome composition was composed of 13953804 sequences from 59 study participants, with 102305.95$\pm$19095.60 and 64823.41$\pm$15841.65 (mean$\pm$SD) reads/sample before and following the quality-check stage, accordingly. There was not a significant distinction between the PTB and FTB groups with regard to on alpha diversity nor beta diversity metrics (Figure \ref{fig:PTB-diversity}).

                DESeq2 was used to select 32 DAT that distinguish between the PTB and FTB groups out of the 465 species that were examined \cite{DESeq2-1}: 26 FTB-enriched DAT and six PTB-enriched DAT. Seven PROM-related DAT were removed from these 32 PTB-related DAT to lessen the confounding effect of PROM (Figure \ref{fig:PTB-volcano}). Therefore, there were a total of 25 PTB-related DAT: 22 FTB-enriched DAT and three PTB-enriched DAT (Figure \ref{fig:PTB-DAT}).

                A significant negative correlation was found using Pearson correlation analysis between GW and differences between PTB-enriched DAT and FTB-enriched DAT ($r = \textrm{-}0.542$ and $p = 7.8\textrm{e-}6$; Figure \ref{fig:PTB-volcano}).

            \subsubsection{Random forest classification to predict PTB risk}
                To classify PTB according to DAT, random forest classifiers were constructed. The nine most significant DAT were used to obtain the best BA (0.765$\pm$0.071; Figure \ref{fig:PTB-ML}a). Moreover, random forest classification model determined each DAT's importance (Figure \ref{fig:PTB-ML}b). We conducted a validation procedure on nine twin pregnancies that were excluded in the initial study design in order to confirm the reliability and dependability of our random forest-based PTB prediction model (Figure \ref{fig:PTB-validation}). Comparable to the PTB prediction model on the 59 initial singleton study participants, the validation classification on PTB risk of these twin participants have an accuracy of 87.5\%.

        \subsection{Discussion}
            In this study, we employed salivary microbiome compositions to develop the random forest-based PTB prediction models to estimate PTB risks. Previous reports have indicated bidirectional associations between pregnancy outcomes and salivary microbiome compositions \cite{PTB-mechanism-3}. Nevertheless, the salivary microbiome composition is not yet elucidated. Salivary microbial dysbiosis, including gingival inflammation and periodontitis, have been connected to unfavorable pregnancy outcomes, such as PTB \cite{PTB-mechanism-6}. However, the techniques utilized in recent research that primarily focus on recognized infections have led to inconsistent outcomes.

            One of the most common salivary taxa that has been examined is \textit{Fusobacterium nucleatum} \cite{Fusobacterium-1, Fusobacterium-2, Fusobacterium-3}, that is a Gram-negative, anaerobic, and filamentous bacteria. \textit{Fusobacterium nucleatum} can be separated from not only the salivary microbiome but also the vaginal microbiome \cite{PTB-mechanism-7, PTB-mechanism-8}. In both animal and human investigation, \textit{Fusobacterium nucleatum} infection has been linke to risk of PTB \cite{Fusobacterium-4}. According to recent researches, the placenta women who give birth prematurely may include additional salivary microbiome dysbiosis, such as \textit{Bergeyella} spp. and \textit{Porphyromonas gingivalis} \cite{Porphyromonas-1, Porphyromonas-2}. Although \textit{Bergeyella} spp. were one of the PROM-overrepresented DAT (Figure \ref{fig:PTB-volcano}), it was excluded in the final 25 PTB-related DAT. Furthermore,  \textit{Porpyhromonas gingivalis} and \textit{Campylobacter gracilis} were pathogens of periodontitis in sub-gingival microbiome \cite{PTB-mechanism-9}. \textit{Lactobacillus gasseri} was also one of the FTB-enriched DAT (Figure \ref{fig:PTB-DAT}), and it is well established that early PTB risk can be reduced by \textit{Lactobacillus gasseri} in the vaginal microbiome \cite{PTB-mechanism-10, PTB-mechanism-11}.

            With DAT comprising 22 FTB-enriched DAT and three PTB-enriched DAT (Figure \ref{fig:PTB-DAT}), we discovered that the FTB study participants had the majority of the essential DAT that distinguished between the PTB and FTB groups. Thus, we hypothesize that the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of PTB may have been triggered by an absence of species with protective characteristics. The association between unfavorable pregnancy outcomes and a dysfunctional microbiome has been explained through two distinct processes. According to the first hypothesis, periodontal pathogens originating in the gingival biofilm might spread from the infected salivary microbiome over the placenta microbiome, invade the intra-amniotic fluid and fetal circulation, and then have a direct impact on the fetoplacental unit, leading to bacteremia \cite{Periodontitis-1}. Based on the second hypothesis, inflammatory mediators and endotoxins that generated by the sub-gingival inflammation and derived from dental plaque of periodontitis may spread throughout the body and reach the fetoplacental unit \cite{PTB-mechanism-12, PTB-mechanism-13}. Despite belonging to the same species, some subgroups of the salivary microbiome may influence pregnancy outcomes in both favorable and adverse manners. Following this line of argumentation, the salivary microbiome composition or their dysbiosis are more significant than the existence of particular bacteria.

            Notably, microbial alteration that take place throughout pregnancy may be expected results of a healthy pregnancy. Those pregnancy-related vulnerabilities to dental problem like periodontitis can be explained by three factors. Because of hormone-driven gingival hyper-reactivity to the salivary microbiome in the oral biofilm including sub-gingival biofilm, these conditions are prevalent in pregnant women. For insight at the relationship between the salivary microbiome compositions and PTB, further studies with pathway analysis are warranted.

            Our study confirmed that salivary microbiome composition could provide potential biomarkers for predicting pregnancy complications including PTB risks using random forest-based classification models, despite a limited number of study participants and a tiny validation sample size. Another limitation of our study was 16S rRNA sequencing. In other words, unlike the shotgun sequencing, 16S rRNA gene sequencing only focused on bacteria, not viruses nor fungi. We did not delve into other variables like nutrition status and socioeconomic statuses of study participants that might affect the salivary microbiome composition.

            Notwithstanding these limitations, this prospective examination showed the promise of the random forest-based PTB prediction models based on mouthwash-derived salivary microbiome composition. Before applying the methods developed in this study in a clinical context, more multi-center and extensive research is warranted to validate our findings.

        \subsection{Introduction}
            Saliva microbial dysbiosis brought on by the accumulation of plaque results in periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the tissue that surrounds the tooth \cite{Periodontitis-2}. Loss of periodontal attachment is a consequence of periodontitis, which may lead to irreversible bone loss and, eventually, permanent tooth loss if left untreated. A new classification criterion of periodontal diseases was created in 2018, about 20 years after the 1999 statements of the previous one \cite{Periodontitis-4}. Even with this evolution, radiographic and clinical markers of periodontitis progression remain the primary methods for diagnosing periodontitis \cite{Periodontitis-4}. Such tools, nevertheless, frequently demonstrate the prior damage from periodontitis rather than its present condition. Certain individuals have a higher risk of periodontitis, a higher chance of developing severe generalized periodontitis, and a worse response to common salivary bacteria control techniques utilized to prevent and treat periodontitis. As a result, the 2017 framework for diagnosing periodontitis additionally allows for the potential development of biomarkers to enhance diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis \cite{Periodontitis-5}. Instead of only depending on the progression of periodontitis, a new etiological indication based on the current state must be introduced in order to enable appropriate intervention through early detection of periodontitis. Thus, the current clinical diagnostic techniques that rely on periodontal probing can be uncomfortable for patients with periodontitis \cite{Periodontitis-6}.

            Due to the development of salivaomics, in this manner, the examination of saliva has emerged as a significant alternative to the conventional ways of identifying periodontitis \cite{Periodontitis-diagnosis-1, Periodontitis-diagnosis-2}. Given that saliva sampling is non-invasive, painless, and accessible to non-specialists, it may be a valuable instrument for diagnosing periodontitis \cite{Periodontitis-diagnosis-3}. Furthermore, much research has suggested that periodontitis could be a trigger in the development and exacerbation of metabolic syndrome \cite{Periodontitis-metabolic-1, Periodontitis-metabolic-2}. Consequently, alteration in these levels of salivary microbiome markers may serve as high effective diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic indicators for periodontitis and other systemic diseases \cite{Periodontitis-diagnosis-4, Periodontitis-diagnosis-5}. The pathogenesis of periodontitis typically comprises qualitative as well as quantitative alterations in the salivary microbial community, despite that it is a complex disease impacted by a number of contributing factors including age, smoking status, stress, and nourishment \cite{Periodontitis-7, Periodontitis-8}. Depending on the severity of periodontitis, the salivary microbial community's diversity and characteristics vary \cite{Periodontitis-7}, indicating that a new etiological diagnostic standards might be microbial community profiling based on clinical diagnostic criteria. As a consequence, salivary microbiome compositions have been characterized in numerous research in connection with periodontitis. High-throughput sequencing, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing, has recently used in multiple studies to identify variations in the bacterial composition of sub-gingival plaque collections from periodontal healthy individuals and patients with periodontitis \cite{Periodontitis-9, Periodontitis-10, Periodontitis-11}. This realization has rendered clear that alterations in the salivary microbial community--especially, shifts to dysbiosis--are significant contributors to the pathogenesis and development of periodontitis \cite{Periodontitis-12}. Yet most of these research either focused only on the microbiome alterations in sub-gingival plaque collection, comprised a limited number of periodontitis study participants, or did not account for the impact of multiple severities of periodontitis.

            For the objective of diagnosing periodontitis, previous research has developed machine learning-based prediction models based on oral microbiome compositions, such as the sub-gingival microbial dysbiosis index \cite{Periodontitis-diagnosis-6, Periodontitis-diagnosis-7}, which have demonstrated good diagnostic evaluation and could be applied to individual saliva collection. Despite offering valuable details, these indicators are frequently restricted by their limited emphasis on classifying the multiple severities of periodontitis. Furthermore, many of these machine learning models currently in practice are trained solely upon the existence of periodontitis rather than on the multiple severities of periodontitis.

            Recently, we employed multiplex quantitative-PCR and machine learning-based classification model to predict the severity of periodontitis based on the amount of nine pathogens of periodontitis from saliva collections \cite{Periodontitis-diagnosis-8}. On the other hand, the fact that we focused merely at nine pathogens for periodontitis and neglected the variety bacterial species associated to the various severities of periodontitis constrained the breadth of our investigation. By developing a machine learning model that could classify multiple severities of periodontitis based on the salivary microbiome composition, this study aims to fill these knowledge gaps and produce more accurate and therapeutically useful guidance to evaluate progression of periodontitis. Hence, in order to examine the salivary microbiome composition of both healthy controls and patients with periodontitis in multiple stages, we applied 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Furthermore, employing the 2018 classification criteria, we sought to find biomarkers (species) for the precise prediction of periodontitis severities \cite{Periodontitis-4, Periodontitis-13}.

        \subsection{Materials and methods}
            \subsubsection{Study participants enrollment}
                Between 2018-08 and 2019-03, 250 study participants--100 healthy controls, 50 patients with stage I periodontitis, 50 patients with stage II periodontitis, and 50 patients with stage III periodontitis--visited visited the Department of Periodontics at Pusan National University Dental Hospital. The Institutional Review Board of the Pusan National University Dental Hospital accepted this study protocol and design (IRB No. PNUDH-2016-019). Every study participants provided their written informed authorization after being fully informed about this study's objectives and methodologies. Exclusion criteria for the study participants are followings:
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item People who, throughout the previous six months, underwent periodontal therapy, including root planing and scaling.
                    \item People who struggle with systemic conditions that may affect periodontitis developments, such as diabetes.
                    \item People who, throughout the previous three months, were prescribed anti-inflammatory medications or antibiotics.
                    \item Women who were pregnant or breastfeeding.
                    \item People who have persistent mucosal lesions, e.g. pemphigus or pemphigoid, or acute infection, e.g. herpertic gingivostomatitis.
                    \item Patient with grade C periodontitis or localized periodontitis ($<$ 30\% of teeth involved).
                \end{enumerate}

            \subsubsection{Periodontal clinical parameter diagnosis}
                A skilled periodontist conducted each clinical procedure. Six sites per tooth were used to quantify gingival recession and probing depth: mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, midlingual, and distolingual \cite{Periodontitis-3}. A periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy, IL, USA) was placed parallel to the major axis of the tooth at each tooth location in order to gather measurements. The cementoenamel junction of the tooth was analyzed to determine the clinical attachment level, and the deepest point of probing was taken to determine the periodontal pocket depth from the marginal gingival level of the tooth. Plaque index was measured by probing four surfaces per tooth: mesial, distal, buccal, and palatal or lingual. Plaque index was scored by the following criteria:
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \setcounter{enumi}{-1}
                    \item No plaque present.
                    \item A thin layer of plaque that adheres to the surrounding tissue of the tooth and free gingival margin. Only through the use of a periodontal probe on the tooth surface can the plaque be existed.
                    \item Significant development of soft deposits that are visible within the gingival pocket, which is a region between the tooth and gingival margin.
                    \item Considerable amount of soft matter on the tooth, the gingival margin, and the gingival pocket.
                \end{enumerate}

                The arithmetic average of the plaque indices collected from every tooth was determined to calculate plaque index of each study participant. By probing four surfaces per tooth, mesial, distal, buccal, and palatal or lingual, to assess gingival bleeding, the gingival index was scored by the following criteria:
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \setcounter{enumi}{-1}
                    \item Normal gingiva: without inflammation nor discoloration.
                    \item Mild inflammation: minimal edema and slight color changes, but no bleeding on probing.
                    \item Moderate inflammation: edema, glazing, redness, and bleeding on probing.
                    \item Severe inflammation: significant edema, ulceration, redness, and spontaneous bleeding.
                \end{enumerate}

                The arithmetic average of the gingival indices collected from every tooth was determined to calculate gingival index of each study participant. The relevant data was not displayed, despite that furcation involvement and bleeding on probing were thoroughly utilized into account during the diagnosis process.

                Periodontitis was diagnosed in respect to the 2018 classification criteria  \cite{Periodontitis-4, Periodontitis-13}. An experienced periodontist diagnosed the periodontitis severity by considering complexity, depending on clinical examinations including radiographic images and periodontal probing. Periodontitis is categorized into healthy, stage I, stage II, and stage III with the following criteria:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Healthy:
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item Bleeding sites $<$ 10\%
                        \item Probing depth: $\le$ 3 mm
                    \end{enumerate}

                    \item Stage I:
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item No tooth loss because of periodontitis.
                        \item Inter-dental clinical attachment level at the site of the greatest loss: 1-2 mm
                        \item Radiographic bone loss: $<$ 15\%
                    \end{enumerate}

                    \item Stage II:
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item No tooth loss because of periodontitis.
                        \item Inter-dental clinical attachment level at the site of the greatest loss: 3-4 mm
                        \item Radiographic bone loss: 15-33\%
                    \end{enumerate}

                    \item Stage III:
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item Teeth loss because of periodontitis: $\le$ teeth
                        \item Inter-dental clinical attachment level at the site of the greatest loss: $\ge$ 5 mm
                        \item Radiographic bone loss: $>$ 33\%
                    \end{enumerate}
                \end{itemize}

            \subsubsection{Saliva sampling and DNA extraction procedure}
                All study participants received instructions to avoid eating, drinking, brushing, and using mouthwash for at least an hour prior to the saliva sample collection process. These collections were conducted between 09:00 and 11:00. Mouth rinse was collected by rinsing the mouth for 30 seconds with 12 mL of a solution (E-zen Gargle, JN Pharm, Korea). All saliva samples were tagged with anonymous ID and stored at -4 \textcelsius.

                Bacteria DNA was extracted from saliva samples using an Exgene\texttrademark Clinic SV DNA extraction kit (GeneAll, Seoul, Korea), and quality and quantity of bacterial DNA was measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). Hyper-variable regions (V3-V4) of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified using the following primer:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Forward: \texttt{5'-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3'}
                    \item Reverse: \texttt{5'-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3'}
                \end{itemize}

                The standard protocols of the Illumina 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation were followed in the preparation of the libraries.The PCR conditions were as follows:
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item Heat activation for 30 seconds at 95 \textcelsius.
                    \item 25 cycles for 30 seconds at 95 \textcelsius.
                    \item 30 seconds at 55 \textcelsius.
                    \item 30 seconds at 72 \textcelsius.
                \end{enumerate}

                NexteraXT Indexed Primer was applied to amplification 10 $\mu$L of the purified initial PCR products for the final library creation. The second PCR used the same conditions as the first PCR conditions but with 10 cycles. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed via 2$\times$300 bp paired-end sequencing at Macrogen Inc. (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea) using Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).

            \subsubsection{Bioinformatics analysis}
                We computed alpha-diversity and beta-diversity indices to quantify the divergence of phylogenetic information. Following alpha-diversity indices were calculated using the scikit-bio Python package (version 0.5.5) \cite{scikit-bio-1}, and these alpha-diversity indices were compared using the MWU test.:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Abundance-based Coverage Estimator (ACE) \cite{ACE-1}
                    \item Chao1 \cite{chao1-1}
                    \item Fisher \cite{fisher-1}
                    \item Margalef \cite{margalef-1}
                    \item Observed ASVs \cite{observed-ASVs-1}
                    \item Berger-Parker $d$ \cite{Berger-1}
                    \item Gini index \cite{Gini-1}
                    \item Shannon \cite{Shannon-1}
                    \item Simpson \cite{Simpson-1}
                \end{itemize}

                Aitchison index for a beta-diversity index was calculated using QIIME2 (version 2020.8) \cite{Aitchison-1, QIIME2-1}. We employed the t-SNE algorithm to illustrate multi-dimensional data from the beta-diversity index computation \cite{tSNE-1}. The beta-diversity index was compared using the PERMANOVA test \cite{PERMANOVA-1, PERMANOVA-2} and MWU test.

                DAT between multiple periodontitis stages were identified by ANCOM \cite{ANCOM-1}. The log-transformed absolute abundances of DAT were analyzed by hierarchical clustering in order to identify sub-groups with similar abundance patterns on periodontitis severities. Additionally, we examined the relative proportions among the 20 DAT in order to reduce the effect of salivary bacteria that differ insignificantly across the multiple severities of periodontitis.

                Differentially abundant taxa (DAT) among multiple periodontitis severities were selected from the salivary microbiome compositions by ANCOM \cite{ANCOM-1}. In contrast to conventional techniques that examine raw abundance counts, ANCOM applies log-ratio between taxa to account for the salivary microbiome composition data. The log-transformed abundances of DAT were subjected to hierarchical clustering to discover subgroups of DAT with similar patterns on periodontitis severities. Furthermore, we examined the relative proportion among the DAT in order to reduce the effects of other salivary bacteria that differ non-non-significantly across the multiple periodontitis severities.

                As previously stated \cite{Periodontitis-diagnosis-8}, we used stratified $k$-fold cross-validation ($k=10$) by severity of periodontitis to achieve consistent and trustworthy classification results \cite{Kfold-1}. Additionally, we utilized various features with confusion matrices and their derivations to evaluate the classification outcomes in order to identify which features optimize classification evaluations and decrease sequencing efforts. Using the DAT discovered by ANCOM, we iteratively removed the least significant taxa from the input features (taxa) of the random forest classification models using the backward elimination method.

                We investigated external datasets from Spanish individuals \cite{Periodontitis-10} and Portuguese individuals \cite{Periodontitis-Portuguese-1} to confirm that our random forest classification was consistent. To ascertain repeatability and dependability, the external datasets were processed using the same pipeline and parameters as those used for our study participants.

            \subsubsection{Data and code availability}
                All sequences from the 250 study participants have been added to the Sequence Read Archives (project ID PRJNA976179): \url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA976179}. Docker image that employed throughout this study is available in the DockerHub: \url{https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fumire/periodontitis_16s}. Every code used in this study can be found on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/CompbioLabUnist/Periodontitis_16S}.

        \subsection{Results}
            \subsubsection{Summary of  clinical information and sequencing data}
                Among clinical information of the study participants, clinical attachment level, probing depth, plaque index, and gingival index, were significantly increased with periodontitis severity (Kruskal-Wallis test $p < 0.001$), while sex were observed no significant difference (Table \ref{tab:PTB-clinical}). Notably, clinical attachment level and probing depth have significant differences among the periodontitis severities (MWU test $p < 0.01$; Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-clinical}). Additionally, 71461.00$\pm$11792.30 and 45909.78$\pm$11404.65 reads per sample were obtained before and after filtering low-quality reads and trimming extra-long tails, respectively (Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-QC}).

            \subsubsection{Diversity indices reveal differences among the periodontitis severities}
                Rarefaction curves showed that the sequencing depth was sufficient (Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-rarefaction}). Alpha-diversity indices indicated significant differences between the healthy and the periodontitis stages (MWU test $p < 0.01$;Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-diversity}a-e); however, there were no significant differences between the periodontitis stages. This emphasizes how essential it is to classify the salivary microbiome compositions and distinguish between the stages of periodontitis using machine learning approaches.

                The confidence ellipses of the tSNE-transformed beta-diversity index (Aitchison index) indicated distinct distributions among the periodontitis severities (PERMANOVA $p \le 0.001$; Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-diversity}f). Aitchison index demonstrated significant differences every pairwise of the periodontitis severities (PERMANOVA test $p \le 0.001$; Table \ref{tab:Periodontitis-beta}). Significant differences in the distances between periodontitis severities further demonstrated the uniqueness of each severity of periodontitis (MWU test $p \le 0.05$; Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-diversity}g-j).

            \subsubsection{DAT among multiple periodontitis severities and their correlation}
                Of the 425 total taxa that identified in the salivary microbiome composition (Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-abundance}), 20 DAT were identified (Table \ref{tab:Periodontitis-DAT}). Three separate subgroups were formed from the participants-level abundances of the DAT using a hierarchical clustering methodology (Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-DAT}a):
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Group 1
                    \begin{enumerate}

                Ten DAT that were significant enriched in stage II and stage III, but deficient in healthy formed Group 1. Furthermore, in comparison to the healthy, the seven DAT of Group 2 were significantly enriched in each of the stages of periodontitis. On the other hand, three DAT in Group 3 were deficient in stage II and stage III, but significantly enriched in healthy. The relative proportions of the DAT further supported these findings (Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-DAT}b), suggesting that the DAT is primarily linked to periodontitis rather than other salivary bacteria.

                Correlation analysis from the DAT showed that DAT from Group 3 was negatively correlated with Group 1 and Group 2 (Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-correlation}), and strong correlations were observed the nine pairs of DAT (Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-correlation2}).

            \subsubsection{Classification of periodontitis severities by random forest models}
                Based on the proportion of DAT, random forest classifier were trained to classify the periodontitis severities (Table \ref{tab:Periodontitis-importance}). First of all, we conducted multi-label classification for the multiple periodontitis severities, namely healthy, stage I, stage II, and stage III. In this setting, we classified multiple periodontitis severities with the highest BA of 0.779$\pm$0.029 (Table \ref{tab:Periodontitis-ML}). AUC ranged between 0.81 and 0.94 (Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-ML}b).

                Second, since timely detection in dentistry is demanding \cite{Periodontitis-5}, we implemented a random forest classification for both healthy and stage I. Remarkably, the random forest classifier had the highest BA at 0.793$\pm$0.123 (Table \ref{tab:Periodontitis-ML}). In this setting, this model showed high AUC value for the classifying of stage I from healthy (AUC=0.85; Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-ML}d).

                Third, based on the findings that the salivary microbiome composition in stage II is more comparable to those in stage III than to other severities (Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-diversity}f and Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-diversity}j), we combined stage II and stage III to perform a multi-label classification.

        \subsection{Discussion}
            In order to investigate at potential alterations in the salivary microbiome compositions based on periodontal statuses, including healthy, stage I, stage II, and stage III, we employed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to perform a cross-sectional periodontitis analysis. In this study, the 2018 periodontitis classification served as the basis for the classification of periodontitis severities \cite{Periodontitis-4}. There were notable variations in the salivary microbiome composition among the multiple severities of periodontitis (Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-abundance}). Furthermore, our random forest classification model based on the proportions of DAT in the salivary microbiome compositions across study participants to predict multiple periodontitis statuses with high AUC of 0.870$\pm$0.079 (Table \ref{tab:Periodontitis-ML}).

            Previous research identified the red complex as the primary pathogens of periodontitis \cite{Periodontitis-14}: \textit{Porphyromonas gingivalis}, \textit{Tannerella forsythia}, and \textit{Treponema denticola}. Other studies, however, have shown that periodontal pathogens communicate with other bacteria in the salivary microbiome networks to generate dental plaque prior to the pathogenesis and development of periodontitis \cite{Periodontitis-15, Periodontitis-16, Periodontitis-17}.

            Using subgingival plaque collections, recent researches have suggested a connection between the periodontitis severity and the salivary microbiome compositions \cite{Periodontitis-9, Periodontitis-10, Periodontitis-11}. Therefore, we have examined the salivary microbiome compositions of patients with multiple severities of periodontitis and periodontally healthy controls, extending on earlier studies.

            According to our findings, the salivary microbiome compositions have 425 taxa (Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-abundance}). We computed the alpha-diversity indices to determine the variability within each salivary microbiome composition, including ace \cite{ACE-1}, chao1 \cite{chao1-1}, fisher alpha \cite{fisher-1}, margalef \cite{margalef-1}, observed ASVs \cite{observed-ASVs-1}, Berger-Parker $d$ \cite{Berger-1}, Gini index \cite{Gini-1}, Shannon \cite{Shannon-1}, and Simpson \cite{Simpson-1} (Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-diversity} and Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-alpha}). Alpha-diversity indices suggested that the microbial richness of periodontally healthy controls was higher than that of patients with periodontitis (Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-diversity}a-e and Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-alpha}). These results are in line with findings with that patients with advanced periodontitis, namely stage II and stage III, have less diversified communities than periodontally healthy controls \cite{Periodontitis-18}. Recognizing that the periodontitis severity increases the amount of \textit{Porphyromonas gingivalis}, the salivary microbiome compositions from periodontally healthy controls conserved microbial networks dominated by \textit{Streptococcus} spp. (Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-abundance}). \textit{Porphyromonas gingivalis} is one of the known periodontal pathogen that could cause dysbiosys in the salivary microbiomes, suggesting in the pathophysiology of periodontitis. Despite this finding, earlier research found that subgingival microbiome of patients with periodontitis had a greater alpha-diversity index (observed ASVs) than that of healthy controls \cite{Periodontitis-10}, might due to the different sampling sites between saliva and subgingival plaque. On the other hand, another research has addressed significant discrepancies in alpha-diversity indices from subgingival plaque, saliva, and tongue biofilms from healthy controls and periodontitis patients, resulting the highest alpha-diversity index in saliva collections \cite{Periodontitis-19}. Moreover, early-stage periodontitis, namely stage I, did not determine statisticall ysignificant differences in alpha-diversity indices compared to advanced periodontitis, including stage II and stage III (Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-diversity}a-e). Accordingly, saliva collection of stage I periodontitis may exhibit heterogeneity, indicating a midpoint condition between a healthy state and advanced periodontitis (stage II and stage III). Likewise, gingivitis is often associated with low abundances of the majority of periodontal pathogens, including \textit{Porphyromonas gingivalis}, \textit{Tannerella forsythia}, and \textit{Treponema denticola} \cite{Periodontitis-7}. Compared to healthy controls, patients with stage I periodontitis have higher detection rates of \textit{Porphyromonas gingivalis} and \textit{Tannerella forsythia} \cite{Periodontitis-20, Periodontitis-21}.

            Therefore, we calculated beta-diversity indices to analyze the differences between the study participants. The distances for the multiple stages of periodontitis, including stage I, stage II, and stage III, as well as healthy controls (Figure \ref{fig:PTB-diversity}g-j and Table \ref{tab:Periodontitis-beta}), suggesting notable differences among the multiple periodontitis severities. In other words, the composition of the salivary microbiome compositions varies depending on the periodontitis stages, so that supporting the findings from a previous study \cite{Periodontitis-10}. Taken together that it is nearly impossible to fully restore the attachment level after it has been lost due to the progression and development of periodontitits, the ability to rapidly screen for periodontitis in its early phases using saliva collections would be highly beneficial for effective disease management and treatment.

            Of the total of 425 taxa in the salivary microbiome composition that have been identified (Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-abundance}), ANCOM was applied to select 20 taxa as the DAT that indicated notable abundance variation among the periodontitis severities (Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-DAT} and Table \ref{tab:Periodontitis-DAT}). Three sub-groups were formed from the DAT using hierarchical clustering (Figure \ref{fig:Periodontitis-DAT}a). Surprisingly, two of the red complex pathogens \cite{Periodontitis-22}, \textit{Porphyromonas gingivalis} and \textit{Tannerella forsythia}, were classified in Group 2 and were more prevalent in stage II and stage II periodontitis compared to healthy controls. \textit{Campylobacter showae} was additionally placed in Group 2 of the orange complex pathogens \cite{Periodontitis-23}. Furthermoe, some of the DAT in Group 2 have reported their crucial roles in pathogenesis and development of periodontitis: \textit{Filifactor alocis} \cite{Periodontitis-24}, \textit{Treponema putidum} \cite{Periodontitis-25}, \textit{Tannerella forsythia} \cite{Periodontitis-26, Periodontitis-27}, and \textit{Prevotella intermedia} \cite{Periodontitis-28}. Taken together, this indicates that DAT in Group 2 is essential to periodontitis.
