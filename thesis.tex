% Abstract
    \begin{abstract}
        The microbiome refers to the complex community of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microbes, that inhabit various environment within living organisms \cite{microbiome-1, microbiome-3}. In humans, the microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining health \cite{microbiome-2}, influencing processes such as digestion \cite{microbiome-digestion-1}, immune response \cite{microbiome-immune-1, microbiome-immune-2, microbiome-immune-3}, and even mental health \cite{microbiome-mental-1, microbiome-mental-2, microbiome-mental-3}. These microbial communities are not static nor constant but rather dynamic ecosystem that interact with their host and respond to environmental changes. Recent studies have revealed that imbalances in the microbiome, known as dysbiosis, can contribute to a wide range of diseases, including obesity \cite{microbiome-obesity-1, microbiome-obesity-2, microbiome-obesity-3}, diabetes \cite{microbiome-diabetes-1, microbiome-diabetes-2, microbiome-diabetes-3}, infections \cite{microbiome-infection-1, microbiome-infection-2}, inflammatory conditions \cite{microbiome-inflammation-1, microbiome-inflammation-2, microbiome-inflammation-3}, and cancers \cite{microbiome-cancer-1, microbiome-cancer-2, microbiome-cancer-3, microbiome-cancer-4}. Thus, understanding the composition of the human microbiome is essential for developing new therapeutic approaches that target these microbial populations to promote health and prevent diseases.

    \section{Predicting preterm birth using machine learning techniques in oral microbiome}
        \label{section:PTB}

        \textbf{This section includes the published contents}: \\
        \input{Documents/PTB.txt} \nocite{PTB-JW-1}

        \subsection{Introduction}
            Preterm birth (PTB), characterized by the delivery of neonates prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is one of the major cause to neonatal mortality and morbidity \cite{PTB-rate-1}. Multiple pregnancies including twins, short cervical length, and infection on genitourinary tract are known risk factor for PTB \cite{PTB-cause-1}. Nevertheless, the extent to which these aspects affect birth outcomes is still up for debate. Henceforth, strategies to boost gestation and enhance delivery outcomes can be more conveniently implemented when pregnant women at high risk of PTB are identified early \cite{PTB-care-1}.

            Prediction models that can be utilized as a foundation for intervention methods still have an unacceptable amount of classification evaluations, including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, despite a great awareness of the risk factors that trigger PTB \cite{PTB-prediction-1}. Several attempts have been made to predict PTB through integrating data such as human microbiome composition, inflammatory markers, and prior clinical data with predictive machine learning methods \cite{PTB-prediction-2}. Because it is affordable and straightforward to use, fetal fibronectin is commonly used in medical applications. However, with a sensitivity of only 56\% that merely similar to random prediction, it has a low classification evaluation \cite{PTB-prediction-3}. Due to the difficulty and imprecision of the method in general, as well as the requirement for a qualified specialist cervical length measuring is also restricted \cite{PTB-prediction-4}.

            Preterm labor and/or preterm pre-labor rupture of membranes (PROM) brought on by gestational inflammation and infection contribute to about 70\% of PTB cases \cite{PTB-prediction-5}. However, the mechanism of PTB cannot be fully explained by inflammatory and infectious pathways as anti-inflammatory and antibiotic treatments could not reduce PTB incidence rates \cite{PTB-mechanism-1}. With advancements in molecular genetic technology, studies on maternal microbiomes using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing have emerged to explore unknown pathways of PTB \cite{PTB-mechanism-2}.

            However, as anti-inflammatory and antibiotic therapies were insufficient to lower PTB occurrence rates, the mechanism of PTB cannot be completely explained by inflammatory and infectious pathways. It has been hypothesized that the microbiota linked to PTB originate from either a hematogenous pathway or the female genitourinary tract increasing through the vagina and/or cervix. \cite{PTB-mechanism-3}. Vaginal microbiome compositions have been found in women who eventually acquire PTB, and recent studies have tried to predict PTB risk using cervicovaginal fluid \cite{PTB-mechanism-4}. Even though previous investigation have confirmed the potential relationships between the vaginal microbiome compositions and PTB, these studies are only able to clarify an upward trajectory.

            Multiple unfavorable birth outcomes, including PROM and PTB, have been linked to periodontitis as an independence risk factor, according to numerous epidemiological researches \cite{PTB-mechanism-5}. It is expected that the oral microbiome will be able to explain additional hematogenous pathways in light of these precedents; however, the oral microbiome composition of fetuses is limited understood.

            Hence, in order to identify the salivary microbiome linked to PTB and to establish a machine learning prediction model of PTB determined by oral microbiome compositions, this study examined the salivary microbiome compositions of PTB study participants with a full-term birth (FTB) study participants.
        \newpage

        \subsection{Materials and methods}
            \subsubsection{Study design and participants}
                Between 2019 and 2021, singleton pregnant women who received treatment to Jeonbuk National University Hospital for childbirth were the participants of this study. The Ethical Research Committee authorized this study (IRB file No. 2019-01-024). Written informed authorization was acquired with preterm labor or PROM, as well as those admitted for induction birth or elective cesarean sections (C-sections), were eligible participants.

            \subsubsection{Data collection and grouping}
                Questionnaires and electronic medical records were implemented to gather information on both previous and current pregnancy outcomes. These data included maternal risk factors, including maternal age at delivery, C-section, PROM, prior history of PTB, gestational or overt diabetes mellitus, pregnancy-induced or chronic hypertension, pre-pregnancy overweight and/or gestational weight gain, along with demographic factors, namely gestational age, birth weight, and sex.

            \subsubsection{Oral microbiome sample collection}
                Using mouthwash, salivary microbiota samples were obtained 24 hours before to delivery. Standard sterilization techniques were used. All sample collection processes were overseen by medical professionals. Thirty minutes prior to sampling, participants were cautioned not to eat, drink, or brush their teeth. By rinsing the mouth for 30 seconds with 12 mL of a gargle solution (E-zen Gargle, JN Pharm, Pyeongtaek, Korea), saliva samples were gathered. Before going through futher processing, the samples were stored at 4 \textcelsius and labeled with the subject's anonymous ID. A microcentrifuge tube was filled with the reconstituted sample. Following the instruction from the manufacturer, genomic DNA was extracted using an ExgeneTM Clinic SV kit (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea) and kept at -20 \textcelsius.

            \subsubsection{16s rRNA gene sequencing and taxonomy assignment}
                For taxonomic assignment, specimens were transported to \input{Documents/Department.txt} of \input{Documents/UNIST.txt}. Afterward, using an Illumina MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) commissioned, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed. The V3 and V4 regions were amplified using library methods. After diluting the samples to a final concentration of 6 pM with 20\% PhiX control, the pooled library was sequenced using a v3 600 cycle chemistry to generated 300 base-pair paired end reads.

            \subsubsection{Bioinformatics and statistical analysis}
                To analyze differences between the PTB participants and the FTB participants, independent $t$-test and $\chi$-square test were implemented. SPSS (version 20.0) was used for clinical measurement comparisons \cite{SPSS-1}. Statistical significance was considered at $p < 0.05$.

                16S rRNA sequences from the salivary samples of study participants were imported with QIIME2 (version 2022.2) for further bioinformatics processing \cite{QIIME2-1}. DADA2 was implemented to check qualities of sequences and to filter low-quality sequences \cite{DADA2-1}. Amplicon sequence variants (ASV) were assigned taxonomy with HOMD (version 15.22) \cite{HOMD-1}. Alpha diversity, a measure of species within a single microbiome community, was calculated using the Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (Faith PD) index \cite{FaithPD-1}. Communities numerically dominated by a few species will exhibit a low Faith PD index, whereas communities in which abundance is distributed equally among species will exhibit a high evenness. Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon $U$-test was used to estimate statistically significant differences in Faith PD index. Beta diversity measures dissimilarity between pairs of communities. It was calculated using the Hamming diversity index \cite{Hamming-1}. PERMANOVA multivariate test was performed to calculate statistically significant differences in the Hamming diversity index \cite{PERMANOVA-1, PERMANOVA-2}.

                To identify differentially abundant taxa (DAT) that have statistically significant differences between the PTB participants and the FTB participants, DESeq2 was implemented using \texttt{DESeqDataSetFromMatrix} method as described in the package tutorial \cite{DESeq2-1}. Taxa with $| \log _2 \textrm{FoldChange} |$ $>$ 1 and adjusted $p < 0.05$ are considered as DAT.

            \subsubsection{Machine learning prediction model development}
                Following qualitative and quantitative analyses of associations between the PTB group and each bacterium, a random forest classifier was used to find the criteria to predict PTB with oral microbiome data. Random forest classification is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that summarizes many decision trees to improve classification evaluations and robustness \cite{RF-1}. Random forest classifier was implemented to predict PTB based on oral microbiome compositions. To assure consistence and reliable classification results \cite{Kfold-1}, we performed stratified $k$-fold cross-validation ($k=5$). Moreover, to decide the best features that could maximize classification evaluations, we performed random forest classification evaluations only with some DAT selected by their importances. Evaluations for classification included accuracy (ACC), balanced accuracy (BA), precision (PRE), sensitivity (SEN), and specificity (SPE).

            \subsubsection{Ethics approval and consent to participate}
                The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Jeonbuk National University Hospital (IRB No. 2019-01-024) and was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki \cite{Helsinki-1}.
        \newpage

        \subsection{Results}
            \subsubsection{Study participant demographics}
                In this study, a total of 69 volunteer mothers were initially recruited. However, one participant with incomplete data and nine individuals with twin pregnancies were excluded from the study cohort. As a result, 59 women (30 in the PTB group and 29 in the FTB group) were included in the final analysis. Demographic and clinical characteristics of subjects in the PTB group and the FTB group are summarized in Table \ref{tab:PTB-clinical}. Because PROM is a major cause of preterm birth, it was significantly higher in PTB group. There was no significant difference in other maternal clinical characteristics between the PTB group and the FTB group. There were no cases with a history of smoking or concurrent periodontal disease in both groups.

            \subsubsection{Comparison of oral microbiomes}
                The oral microbiome comprised 13953804 sequences from 59 salivary samples, with 102305.95$\pm$19095.60 and 64823.41$\pm$15841.65 reads per sample before and after filtering low-quality reads and trimming extra-long tails, respectively. After filtering low-quality reads and trimming extra-long tails, remaining representative reads were clustered in ASVs with their exact sequence match. There were no significant differences in measures of alpha diversity (Faith PD) and beta diversity (Hamming distance) indices for samples between the PTB group and the FTB group (Figure \ref{fig:PTB-diversity}).

                Of 465 genera and species analyzed, 32 DAT between the PTB group and the FTB group were selected by DESeq2 \cite{DESeq2-1}, including 26 FTB-enriched DAT and six PTB-enriched DAT. In order to mitigate the confounding effect of PROM, we excluded 7 PROM-related DATs from these 32 DAT (Figure \ref{fig:PTB-volcano}). There were a total of 25 DATs between the PTB group and the FTB group, with 22 DATs enriched in the FTB group and three in the PTB group, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:PTB-DAT}.

                Figure \ref{fig:PTB-composition} displays DAT volcano plot in the oral microbiome sorted by differences between FTB-enriched DAT and PTB-enriched DAT proportions, indicating a decrease in gestational age for FTB-enriched DAT proportions. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a strong negative correlation ($r = -0.542$ and $p = 7.8\textrm{e}-6$) between gestational age and difference between PTB-enriched DAT and FTB-enriched DAT proportions.

            \subsubsection{Random forest classification}
                Random forest classifiers were established to classify PTB based on DAT. The best BA(0.765 $\pm$ 0.071) was achieved using the nine most important taxa (Figure \ref{fig:PTB-ML}a). The Random forest model calculated the importance of each DAT (Figure \ref{fig:PTB-ML}b). Overall ACC, PRE, SEN, and SPE were 0.714$\pm$0.061, 0.700$\pm$0.194, 0.728$\pm$0.058, and 0.743 $\pm$ 0.138, respectively. To validate the performance of our machine learning prediction model, we conducted a validation test on nine twin pregnancies that were excluded from the paper (Figure \ref{fig:PTB-validation}). On PTB subjects of these twin samples, the machine learning classifications have 87.5\% accuracy, comparable to the machine learning classification on the singleton study subjects.

        \subsection{Discussion}
            In this study, we developed a method for predicting PTB based on random forest classifier using salivary microbiome compositions. Recently, several sporadic reports have suggested a bidirectional relationship between oral microbiome and pregnancy \cite{PTB-mechanism-3}. However, prenatal oral microbiome is not well understood yet. Some research has shown that oral microbial dysbiosis combined with gingival inflammation can lead to adverse pregnancy  outcomes, including low birth weight, PTB, pre-eclampsia, and miscarriages \cite{PTB-mechanism-6}. Nevertheless, these results have been inconsistent due to methodologies employed in studies that only target known pathogens.

            \textit{Fusobacterium nucleatum} is the most prevalent oral microbiome studied \cite{Fusobacterium-1, Fusobacterium-2, Fusobacterium-3}. \textit{Fusobacterium nucleatum} is a Gramnegative, anaerobic, filamentous oral microbiome. It is considered one of the most abundant species in the oral microbiome. It can also be isolated from vaginal microbiome \cite{PTB-mechanism-7, PTB-mechanism-8}. Intra-amniotic \textit{Fusobacterium nucleatu}m infection leading to PTB has been reported in human and animal studies \cite{Fusobacterium-4}. Other studies have shown that other oral pathogens including \textit{Porphyromonas gingivalis} and intrauterine \textit{Bergeyella} spp. can be isolated from the placenta of women who deliver prematurely \cite{Porphyromonas-1, Porphyromonas-2}. In the present study, although \textit{Bergeyella} spp. was overrepresented in the PTB group with PROM, it was excluded in the finally selected 25 DAT. Furthermore, \textit{Campylobacter gracilis} was one of the FTB-enriched DAT that can aid colonization by periodontal pathogens including \textit{Porpyhromonas gingivalis} in subgingival microbiome \cite{PTB-mechanism-9}. \textit{Lactobacillus gasseri }was also one of the FTB-enriched DAT. It is known that \textit{Lactobacillus gasseri} in vaginal microbiome can decrease early PTB risk \cite{PTB-mechanism-10, PTB-mechanism-11}.

            We found that decisive species differentiating between two groups were mainly abundant in the FTB group, with DAT consisting of 22 FTB-enriched DAT and three PTB-enriched DAT. We hypothesize that deficiency of species having a protective impact might have triggered the pathophysiology of PTB. Two different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the relationship between unhealthy microbiota composition and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The first mechanism proposed that periodontal bacteria originating in the gingival biofilm could translocate from the unhealthy oral cavity and cross the placenta, reach the intra-amniotic fluid and fetal circulation and directly affect the fetoplacental unit, resulting in bacteremia \cite{Periodontitis-1}. The second mechanisms proposed that systemic dissemination of endotoxins and/or inflammatory mediators derived from periodontal plaque and  secreted by the subgingival inflammatory site could be carried to the fetoplacental unit \cite{PTB-mechanism-12, PTB-mechanism-13}. Although certain microbiota has the same species, their subgroups can have both positive and negative influences on pregnancy outcomes. Following this line of thought, we believe that composition or dysbiosis of the oral microbiome is more important than the presence of specific microbiota.

            It is worth nothing that microbial changes occurring during pregnancy might be nature consequences of a healthy pregnancy. Three reasons can explain the susceptibility to oral diseases such as periodontitis during pregnancy. These diseases are common in pregnant women due to hormonally driven hyper-reactivity of the gingiva to bacteria in the subgingival biofilm. Other factors that increase the risk of poor oral health during pregnancy include changes in dietary habits (frequent snacking or increased consumption of carbohydrate-rich foods), stomach acids from nausea and vomiting that contribute to the breakdown of tooth enamel, and a decreased likelihood of seeking dental care during pregnancy. We plan to implement pathway analyses to investigate direct link between the microbiome and PTB.

            Even though there was limited power resulting from a small number of participants and restricted validation sample size, our study verified that oral microbiota might provide potential biomarkers for predicting pregnancy complications using machine learning methods including random forest classification. Additionally, the fact that the entire microbiome was not analyzed was a limitation of this study because our analysis only used relative values measured by 16S rRNA sequencing, not 16S metagenome sequencing. We did not investigate other factors could impact the oral microbiome, such as participant’s diet and socioeconomic status.

            Despite these limitations, this prospective study demonstrated the potential of a PTB prediction model using oral microbiome in mouthwash. Further multi-center and larger-scale studies are needed to confirm out results before applying techniques developed in this study in the clinical field.

Your unwavering commitment to improving the lives of animals has inspired me throughout this journey. I am also thankful for the beautiful cats we have cared for, whose presence brought both joy and purpose to our allegiance. Their playful spirits and gentle companionship served as daily reminders of why we continue to fight for animal rights. The bond we share, both with each other and with the animals we protect, has enriched my life in countless ways. I appreciate you all again for your support, dedication, and for being part of this meaningful cause.

        I would like to express my deepest gratitude to everyone I have had the honor of meeting throughout this journey. Your kindness, encouragement, and support have carried me through both the challenging and rewarding moments of my life. Whether through a kind word, thoughtful advice, or simply being there when I needed it most, your presence has made all the difference. I am incredibly fortunate to have received such generosity and warmth from those around me, and I do not take it for granted. Every act of kindness, no matter how big or small, has been a source of strength and motivation for me. To all my friends, colleagues, mentors, and beloved ones, thank you for your unwavering support. I am truly grateful for each of you, and your kindness has left an indelible mark on my journey.
